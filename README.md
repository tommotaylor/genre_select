## Usage

## Contributing

### Tests

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

### Updating gemfiles
The default rake task will run the tests against multiple versions of
Rails. That means the gemfiles need occasional updating, especially when
changing the dependencies in the gemspec.

```shell
for i in gemfiles/*.gemfile
do
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=$i bundle install --no-deployment
done
```
